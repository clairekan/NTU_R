Intro to basics

kinds of variable:
	Decimals values like 4.5 are called numerics.
	Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
	Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
	Text (or string) values are called characters.

Vectors
Vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data. In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data. 
In R, you create a vector with the combine function c()

numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

names()
some_vector <- c("John Doe", "poker player")
names(some_vector) <- c("Name", "Profession")

sum() adding function

comparison:<,>

choose the vector 
use[] behind the vectors,notice that
c(2, 3, 4) can be abbreviated to2:4, which generates a vector with all natural numbers from 2 up to 4.
