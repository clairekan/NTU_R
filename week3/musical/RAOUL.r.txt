All I Ask of You
No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
my words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom,
let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here with you, beside you,
to guard you and to guide you...
Let me be your shelter
let me be your light
You're safe, No one will find you
your fears are far behind you...
Then say you'll share with me
one love, one lifetime
let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you here, beside you...
anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you...
You know I do...
Love me - that's all I ask of you
Anywhere you go let me go too
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind, this is one
visit I should prefer to make unaccompanied.
Thank you
Say you'll share with me,
one love, one lifetime...
Say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
Free her!
Do what you like only free her!
Have you no pity?
I love her!
Does that mean nothing?
I love her!
Show some compassion ...
Christine, Christine...
Let me see her...
Christine, forgive me please forgive me ...
I did it all for you, and all for nothing
Say you love him and my life is over
For either way you choose, he has to win/you cannot win!
Why make her lie to you, to save me?
For pity's sake,
Christine, say no
Don't throw your life away for my sake
I fought so hard to free you
Say the word and I will follow you
each morning

Little Lotte let her mind wander
Little Lotte thought: Am I fonder of dolls
Or of goblins or shoes?
Those picnics in the attic
Or of chocolates
As we read to each other dark stories of the North
The Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
You sang like an angel tonight
Oh, no doubt of it - And now we'll go to supper!
Well, I shan't keep you up late!
You must change. I must get my hat.
Two minutes - Little Lotte.
Why is it secret? What have we to hide?
You promised me.
Well then let them see.
It's an engagement, not a crime.
Christine, what are you afraid of?
Can it be? Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago, it seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were...
She may not remember me,
but I remember her...
Once again she returns 
. . . to the arms
Of her angel . . .
Angel or demon . . .
Still he calls her . . .
Luring her back, from the grave . . .
Angel or dark seducer . . .?
Who are you, strange
Angel . . .?
Christine! Christine listen to me!
Whatever you may believe, this man . . .
this thing . . . is not your father!

Let her go! For God's sake, let her go! Christine !
