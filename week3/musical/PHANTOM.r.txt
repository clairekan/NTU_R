past the point of no return 
Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for its prey
You have come here
in pursuit of
your deepest urge,
in pursuit of
that wish,
which till now
has been silent,
silent . . .
I have brought you,
that our passions
may fuse and merge -
in your mind
you've already
succumbed to me
dropped all defences
completely succumbed to me -
now you are here with me:
no second thoughts,
you've decided,
decided . . .
Past the point
of no return -
no backward glances:
the games we've played
till now are at
an end . . .
Past all thought
of "if" or "when" -
no use resisting:
abandon thought,
and let the dream
descend . . .
What raging fire
shall flood the soul?
What rich desire
unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction
lies before
us . . .?
Past the point
of no return,
the final threshold -
what warm,
unspoken secrets
will we learn?
Beyond the point
of no return . . .
Past the point
of no return
the final threshold -
the bridge
is crossed, so stand
and watch it burn . . .
We've passed the point
of no return . . .Say you'll share with
me one
love, one lifetime . . .
Lead me, save me
from my solitude . . .

Say you want me
with you,
here beside you . . .
Anywhere you go
let me go too -
Christine
that's all I ask of . . .

Angel of Music 
Bravi, bravi, bravissimi
I gave you my music . . .
made your song take wing . . .
and now, how you've
repaid me:
denied me
and betrayed me . . .
He was bound to love you
when he heard you sing . . .
Christine ...
Christine ...
ou will curse the day you did not do!
All that the Phantom asked of you!


Down once more to the dungeon of my black despair!
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind!
Down that path into darkness deep as hell!
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin, but the wickedness of my abhorrent face!
Hounded out by everyone!
Met with hatred everywhere!
No kind word from anyone!
No compassion anywhere!
Christine, Christine ...
Why, why ...?
That fate which condemns me to wallow in blood, has also denied me the joys of the flesh ...
This face - the infection which poisons our love ...
This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing ...
A mask, my first unfeeling scr*p of clothing ...
Pity comes too late - turn around
and face your fate: an eternity of this before your eyes!
Wait! I think, my dear, we have a guest!
Sir, this is indeed an unparalleled delight!
I had rather hoped that you would come.
And now my wish comes true - you have truly made my night!
Your lover makes a passionate plea!The world showed no compassion to me!
Be my guest, sir ...
Monsieur, I bid you welcome!
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why should I make her pay for the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now!
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes!
Nothing can save you now - except perhaps Christine...
Start a new life with me -
Buy his freedom with your love!
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice -
This is the point of no return!
Too late for turning back, too late for prayers and useless pity!
All hope of cries for help; no point in fighting!
For either way you choose, he has to win/you cannot win!
So, do you end your days with me,
or do you send him to his grave?
Past the point of no return
the final threshold
His life is now the prize which you must earn
You've passed the point of no return
You try my patience - make your choice
Take her - forget me - forget all of this...
Leave me alone - forget all you've seen...
Go now - don't let them find you!
Take the boat - leave me know, swear never to tell, the secrets you know, of the angel in hell
GO NOW!
GO NOW AND LEAVE ME!
Masquerade...
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade...
Hide your face so the world will never find you...
Christine, I love you
You alone can make my song take flight -
it's over now, the music of the night!
You little prying Pandora!
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah!
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free!
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look
or bare to think of me:
this loathsome gargoyle, who burns in h***,
but secretly yearns for heaven,
secretly... secretly...
Christine...
Fear can turn to love - you'll learn to see
to find the man behind the monster:
this repulsive carcass, who seems a beast
but secretly dreams of beauty,
secretly... secretly...
Oh, Christine...
Come, we must return
Those two fools Who run my
theater will be missing you.
Insolent boy!
This slave of fashion
basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool!
This brave young suitor,
sharing in my triumph!
Flattering child
You shall know me,
See why in shadow I hide
Look at your face in the mirror
I am there inside!
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me: Angel of Music
Why so silent, good monsieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good monsieurs?
I have written you an opera.
Here, I bring the finish score.
Don Juan Triumphant!
Fondest greetings to you all
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts
Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick of strutting 'round the stage
Our Don Juan must loose some weight
It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office
Not the arts
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...
No doubt she'll do her best/It's true, her voice is good
She knows, though
Should she wish to excell
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me, her teacher
Her teacher...
Your chains are still mine, you belong to me!

Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon the defenses
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it - tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge all thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before
Softly, deftly music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly poseess you
Open up your mind let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night
Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me
Floating, folding, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation
let the dream begin let your darker side give in
to the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
It's me they hear...
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel!
Sing for me!
Wandering child . . .
So lost . . .
So helpless . . .
Yearning for my
Guidance . . .
Have you forgotten your Angel
Too long you've wandered in winter . . .
RAOUL (to himself a murmur)
Once again
She is his . 
Far from my far-reaching gaze . . .
You resist 
Yet your/the soul
Obeys . . .
Angel of Music!
You denied me/I denied you
Turning from true beauty . . .
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protector . . .
Come to your strange
Angel . . .
I am your Angel of Music . . .
Come to me: Angel of Music
