Past the point of no return
no thoughts
within her head,
but thoughts of joy!
No dreams
within her heart
but dreams of love!
You have brought me
to that moment
where words run dry,
to that moment
where speech
disappears
into silence,
silence . . .
I have come here,
hardly knowing
the reason why . . .
In my mind,
I've already
imagined our
bodies entwining
defenceless and silent -
and now I am
here with you:
no second thoughts,
I've decided,
decided . . .
Past the point
of no return -
no going back now:
our passion-play
has now, at last,
begun . . .
Past all thought
of right or wrong -
one final question:
how long should we
two wait, before
we're one . . .?
When will the blood
begin to race
the sleeping bud
burst into bloom?
When will the flames,
at last, consume
us . . .?Past the point
of no return
the final threshold -
the bridge
is crossed, so stand
and watch it burn . . .
We've passed the point
of no return . . .

all i ask of you
Say you love me every waking moment,
turn my head with talk of summertime...
Say you need me with you now and always...
All I want is freedom,
a world with no more night
and you, always beside me, to hold me and to hide me...Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime...
say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me,
each night, each morning...

Say you love me...Love me - that's all I ask of you
Anywhere you go let me go too
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
that's all I ask of you

When your mother brought me here to live
Whenever I¡¦d come down here alone
To light a candle for my father
A voice from above
And in my dreams
He was always there
You see, when my father lay dying
He told me I will be protected by an angel
An angel of musicwho else, meg?
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing, I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen geniusAngel of Music
Guide and guardian
It frightens me
Say you'll share with me,
one love, one lifetime...
Say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
Grant to me your gloryAngel of Music
Hide no longer
Secret and strange angel He's with me, even now
Promise me that all you say is true
All around me
This haunted face holds no horror for me now ...
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies ...
Please Raoul, it's useless!
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate grow cold, and turn to tears of hate!
Farewell my fallen idol and false friend ...
We had such hopes, and now those hopes are shattered!
Angel of Music..
who deserves this
When will you see reason
Angel of Music
you deceived me.
I gave my mind blindly
Pitiful creature of darkness...
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you you are not alone
Say you'll share with me, one love, one lifetime...
Say the word and I will follow you.
Share each day with me,
each night
each morning

I remember there was mist
swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around,
and on the lake there was a boat,
and in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows?
Whose is the face in the mask?
To my father's grave, please.
In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name...
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing
Her Father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music
Her father promised her? Her father promised her...
Or of goblins or shoes?
Or of riddles of frocks
Father playing the violin
No - what I love best, Lotte said,
is when I'm asleep in my bed
and the Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
Father said, 'When I'm in heaven, child
I will send the Angel of Music to you'.
Well, father is dead, Raoul, and I have been
visited by the Angel of Music.
No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.
Raoul, no No, Raoul, wait!
Angel! I hear you!
Speak, I listen...
Stay by my side, guide me!
Angel, my soul was weak
forgive me...
Enter at last, Master!
Angel of Music!
Guide and guardian!
Grant to me your glory!
Angel of Music!
Hide no longer!
Come to me, strange angel
Think of it
(Spoken)
Our secret engagement.
Look, your future bride.
Just think of it.
No, Raoul, please don't, they'll see.
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice that calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again for now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
Your/My spirit and my/your voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my/your mind
He's there, the phantom of the opera
Think of me, think of me fondly,
when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while -
please promise me you'll try.
When you find that, once again, you long
to take your heart back and be free -
if you ever find a moment,
spare a thought for me
We never said our love was evergreen,
or as unchanging as the sea -
but if you can still remember
stop and think of me . . .
Think of all the things
we've shared and seen -
don't think about the way things
might have been . . .
Think of me, think of me waking,
silent and resigned.
Imagine me, trying too hard
to put you from my mind.
Recall those days
look back on all those times,
think of the things we'll never do -
there will never be a day,
when I won't think of you . . .
Flowers fade,
The fruits of summer fade,
They have their seasons, so do we
but please promise me, that sometimes
you will think of me!
Angel . . . or father . . .
Friend . . . or
Phantom . . . ?
Who is it there,
Staring . . . ?
Angel . . . oh, speak . . .
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper . . .!

Wildly my mind beats against you 
Yet your/the soul
Obeys . . .
You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered
Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seem if I just dream
Somehow you would be here
Wishing I could hear your voice again
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could
Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle
Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die
Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye
Try to forgive teach me to live
Give me the strength to try
No more memories no more silent tears
No more gazing across the wasted years
Help me say goodbye'.
